<# While it is critical that all Domain Controllers in the domain are owned by "Domain Admins", 
it is also very important that all other Computer Objects are properly owned as well.
You may find unexpected AD Computer Object ownership if you use delegated permissions to 
add PCs, Servers, or other Computer Objects to the domain, such as when using Microsoft Deployment Toolkit.
Once Computer Objects with unexpected ownership are discovered via this PoSH 1-liner, they can be remediated 
manually by changing the owner to "Domain Admins" or use of another script can be used to Set-ACL. #>
